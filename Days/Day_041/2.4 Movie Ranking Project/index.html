<h1>The best Movies According to Fernando</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>I remember being very young when I first saw The Matrix, and it was kind of magical. It was the late nineties and early 2000s, a time when technology was completely different from what it is today. At that stage of my life, I had just received my first computer, so everything was very new and a learning experience. The movie itself is an epic, with Neo coming to believe in who he is and changing his own destiny, it's simply touching. At that time, it felt surreal to meâ€”the effects, I couldn't quite grasp what was happening properly. The whole film is full of analogies and metaphors. I think it's by far my favorite movie.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This is by far the film I've seen the most in my life, even though it's not my favorite, I watched it trying to see new things, I remember the first time I saw Tyler before Tyler actually appeared in the film, all every time I saw the film, I saw something new, I don't know exactly how many times I watched this film, but I remember doing a quick calculation in a conversation with a friend, and I had reached 21 times, this conversation was back in 2014... Since then I've seen it a few more times, talking about the film, even though nothing is reality, and I can't talk about it, it manages to capture my reality, the things that the narrator experiences, I feel that I have lived or will live... And the things that Tyler says or does, make me question what I would really like to be doing... In the end, it's a movie that blows your brains out the first time you see it, and he explodes again, when you re-watch it, trying to find things, phrases, easter eggs and the like... In the end, it's one of my favorite films, besides having brad pitt, who is by far my favorite actor... By Because of this film he became my favorite actor in this case...

<h3>Godfather</h3>
<p>Simply a masterpiece, everything in this film works, even if the production didn't, even if we have actors of questionable character (see Marlon Brando), even if there are problems behind the scenes, for me it's the epitome of cinema... It's a GIANT movie, you don't even realize how much time has passed while watching it, for most people it's tiring, but for me it's something that captivates me, everything has a reason, and everything is very well presented, I fall in love with every character and event every time I watch it, even the weak and the bad characters, because they serve a purpose, this movie gives me different things every time I watch it... From the tension created in certain scenes, like Mike's turnaround as soon as he has the meeting in the restaurant, or the scene where a henchman teaches how to make macaroni, which I've actually done, following exactly the steps he says, not to mention that every time the Godfather opens his mouth, it generates a catchphrase, which I use with my friends for fun... Everything in the movie is intense, and even after years, me and my friends continue to repeat lines or moments... Recently, a friend shaved her dog's fur, and unfortunately due to a mistake, some things went wrong, and the animal looked awful, at that moment another friend says to me... "Look at what they did to my boy..." A lot, absolutely a lot of things in the lives of my friends and mine come from references to this movie, whether in passages or lines... The entire work is wonderful, and it's extremely amazing to see the life evolution of each character, each path they take and how it reflects in the end, the initial characters are completely different from the final ones... In short... for me, it's the best-told story in cinema.
